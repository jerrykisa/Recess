 Virtual Memory is a technique that makes the computer appear to have more memory than is actually installed. This works by moving blocks of memory to and from disk as it is needed. Virtual memory often slows down a computer compared to the same computer just using physically installed RAM. The total amount of memory available when using virtual memory is called the 'logical memory'. The actual amount of RAM installed is called the 'physical memory'. Virtual Memory can be turned on or off in the Memory control panel
